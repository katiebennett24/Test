    TakoResume attempts to address the incompetence and constraints of existing job-hunting strategies.
    Job searchers frequently struggle to find suitable work openings, and companies struggle 
        to identify suitable individuals. Conventional means of job searching, such as classified ads,
        have become obsolete, while new techniques, such as online job boards, may not necessarily 
        provide a complete picture of job seekers' talents and experiences. TakoResume offers a 
        comprehensive platform for job searchers to showcase their talents and experiences, 
        while also assisting businesses in finding qualified individuals. TakoResume strives
        to simplify the overall job search process and better match job seekers with suitable 
        job openings by delivering a more streamlined and effective experience for both job 
        searchers and employers.
